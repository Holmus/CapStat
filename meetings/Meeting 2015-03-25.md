# Meeting 2015-03-25

Date: 2015-03-25

Facilitator: Jakob Holmgren

Participants: Rikard Hjort, Jakob Holmgren, Christian Persson, Johan Andersson

### Objectives
Decide the structure of a game. Should the also work for Beer Pong, for example? How is a game played exactly?

### Reports
N/A

### Discussion items
Ranking system.

Input: A referee should register the hits and misses. Could work for beer pong if we make separate modules.

What is the difference between a user, a player and a referee? Should there be separate logins for this?

Should both players approve the game before the stats are submitted? If the referee submits the agme, should it not be loaded until both players have agreed to the game being registered (if someone don't think it is fair game, they can decline to register it).

Flow: start game -> enter player names -> done!

### Outcomes and assignments
A user should be able to start registering game right away, enter player names later.

### Wrap up
Next meeting: 2015-03-30, 8:00
