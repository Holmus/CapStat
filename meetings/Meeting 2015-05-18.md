Facilitator: Rikard Hjort

Participants: Rikard Hjort, Christian Persson, Johan Andersson

### Objectives
The database is not finished yet, and lots of the continued development depends on having a functional database that we can read from and insert into. Fortunately, the database should be almost finished, and work on e.g. statistics can kick off.

### Reports
* `jOOQ` has been integrated to our project and seems to be working as intended.
* There hasn't been much statistics _code_ written, but Christian and Rikard has discussed the design and class hierarchy of the statistics part, and have reached fairly sound solutions.
* The GUI has come a fairly long way, but it's hard to tell if the event bus is working (since Jakob is not present at the meeting, and he has done all the work on the GUI).

### Discussion items
N/A

### Outcomes and assignments
* Christian will continue working on the statistics part of the application, focusing on the "calculator" classes, i.e. the classes that will do the heavy lifting for calculating statistics that are not immediately available.
* Johan will finish the database class, and optimize it as much as possible.
* Rikard will create a class that stores "user tasks" and "match tasks" using the task queue.

### Wrap up
The next meeting will take place on Thursday, 21st of May, 10:00.
