Facilitator: Rikard Hjort

Participants: Rikard Hjort, Christian Persson, Johan Andersson, Jakob Holmgren

### Objectives
There is a very annoying bug in the database code, where throw sequences are not saved correctly.

Some meetings do not have any meeting agendas recorded.

### Reports
Everything from the list of "must finish"-objectives have been fixed, except for RAD and SDD.

The report is finished and has been turned in.

### Discussion items
The RAD has to be finished today, so it is given the highest priority.

Some documents are still only located on the shared Google Drive folder -- these should be converted to Markdown and added to the Git repository.

### Outcomes and assignments
*   Find and fix the annoying database bug.
*   Finish the RAD and convert it to Markdown (or LaTeX, if there is time).
*   Finish the SDD.
*   Convert other documents to Markdown.
*   Create and commit the gradle wrapper, so that it is available when cloning the repository.
*   Create an English rendition of the rules of Caps.

### Wrap up
N/A
