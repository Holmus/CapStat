Date: 2015-05-14

Facilitator: Rikard Hjort

Participants: Rikard Hjort, Christian Persson, Johan Andersson, Jakob Holmgren

### Objectives
N/A

### Reports
`jOOQ` seems to take a little while to integrate, since it has to be integrated into generating code at build time. A gradle build script should resolve this.

Christian has finished the statistics use case. The GUI is making progress.

### Discussion items
N/A

### Outcomes and assignments
*   Johan will look up some tutorials on how to create a gradle buildscript for `jOOQ`.
*   Jakob will continue working on the GUI.
*   Christian and Rikard will discuss the design of statistics classes.

### Wrap up
The next meeting will take place on Monday, 18th of May.
