Date: 2015-05-11

Facilitator: Rikard Hjort

Participants: Rikard Hjort, Christian Persson, Johan Andersson

### Objectives
N/A

### Reports
Jakob is not present, but from earlier internal group communication, it seems that he has made fairly good progress on it.
Christian has finished the task queue interface and implementation, and has merged it in.
Rikard has completed the facade on an interface level, and has created an initial implementatin of the event bus.
Johan has had some problems with git, but has nevertheless made progress on the database and has written code that communicate with it.

### Discussion items
There exists a library called jOOQ that is able to generate code for interacting with the database intelligently from Java. We should probably integrate jOOQ into our project, which will make our lives much easier for flexible database code.

### Outcomes and assignments
* Rikard and Johan will look into jOOQ and how to integrate it into our project.
* Christian will begin work on the statistics part of the application. A use case will be created describing a common statistics task, such as "view the accuracies of the match of the current user, starting from now and going a month back".
* Jakob will continue working on the GUI, using the newly implemented event bus.

### Wrap up
The next meeting will take place on Thursday 14th of May, 10:00.
