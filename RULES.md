# Rules

This is a overview of the rules of caps, and the rules that are used as default by CapStat.

### Beginning of match
In the beginning of the match, the number of glasses and the number of rounds is decided.

### Glasses
The number of glasses is always an odd number. The two players place an equal number of glasses in a line in front of them. These glasses are their "own glasses". The last gloss is known as the "middle glass" and placed in the middle between the two players lines.

### Beginning of round
All glasses are placed in a line between the players, with open-side up. Both players pour ~10cl of their beverage in each of their own glasses. Both players also pour ~10cl each of their beverage in the middle glass, making the amount of liquid in that glass to be ~20cl.

The starting player performs the first throw.
If this is the first round, the starting player is the player who started studying at the school most recently. If both players started the same point in time (year and semester), the youngest player is chosen as the starting player. 
If this is __not__ the first round, the loser of the previous round is chosen as the starting player.

### Playing
Caps consists of two players throwing bottle caps towards each others glasses, aiming for the far-most glass in play. If a player hits the opponents far-most glass (by landing a bottle cap in it), a _duel_ is started.

During a _duel_, play continues as normal by each player throwing bottle caps towards the opponents far-most glass. However, as soon as a player misses - by throwing a bottle cap that does not land in the opponents far-most glass - the duel ends as that player has lost the duel and has to drink the contents of their own closest glass. The player is said to have "lost" that glass. After that, the now empty glass is considered out of play (typically marked by placing the glass upside-down and placing a bottle cap on top of it).

### End of round
Play continues until one of the player loses all their own glasses, and then loses another duel, which means that they have lost the round (leaving them to drink the contents of the middle glass). The round is then ended.

### End of match
The players keep playing new rounds until someone has won enough rounds to win the match. The usual format is best of 3, meaning that the player that first wins two rounds wins the match.
